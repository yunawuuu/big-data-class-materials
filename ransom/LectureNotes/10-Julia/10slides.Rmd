# Julia

- Julia is scientific computing language

- Similar in function to Python, R, or Matlab

- Aims to be a "high-level" language that is performant enough for intensive applications

- "High-level" in the sense that it doesn't require compilation to run

- "Performant" in the sense that it can sometimes run as fast as C, C++ or FORTRAN

- ... and can be considerably faster than Python, R or Matlab.

# What makes Julia different?

- .hi[just in time] (JIT) compilation

- .hi[rich type system], which can yield massive performance gains

- .hi[multiple dispatch] (i.e. the same function can be reused for different types of inputs)

- .hi[metaprogramming] (like macros in Stata)

- .hi[loops don't slow you down] (compared to Matlab or R, where they are very slow)

# Learning Julia

- There are lots of resources for learning Julia

- Ultimately, learning is through experience

- [Julia homepage](https://julialang.org/)

- [Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)

- [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/)

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage)

- [Cheat sheet](https://juliadocs.github.io/Julia-Cheat-Sheet/)

I regularly use all of these resources as I program in Julia

---

# Installing Julia

Go [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions for your computer's operating system

---

# Julia REPL

REPL = .hi[R]ead .hi[E]val .hi[P]rint .hi[L]oop (i.e. the interactive console)

- Open Julia and you should see a prompt that says `julia> `

Stuff the REPL can do:

- basic calculator functions; e.g. `sqrt(π)` which returns 1.77245

- up arrow for last command

- `;` enters shell mode (where you can issue system commands from inside Julia)

- `?` enters help mode, e.g. `?sqrt`

- `]` opens package manager; e.g. `] add LinearAlgebra` (note: may [take awhile](https://twitter.com/chrispdanko/status/1256382196895682560?s=20))


---

# Basic operations (see [cheatsheet](https://juliadocs.github.io/Julia-Cheat-Sheet/) for more details)

- .hi[Array indexing:] use `[]`, e.g. `X[5,2]`

- .hi[Show output:] use `println()`, e.g. `println("size of X is ", size(X))`

- .hi[Assignment:] use `=`, e.g. `X = rand(15,3)`

- .hi[Commenting:] use `#` for single line, `#= ... =#` for multi-line

- .hi[Element-wise operators:] must put a `.` in front, e.g. `x .+ y` if `x` and `y` are arrays

- .hi[Load installed package:] `using Random`

- .hi[Execute script:] `include("myfile.jl")` $\equiv$ `do myfile.do` or `source('myfile.R')`

---

# Creating and executing a Julia script

- In Stata or R, you create a script and then execute it

- The same thing is true in Julia, but with a slight difference

- In Julia, even scripts should have functions wrapped around them

- The following is the contents of `myscript.jl`

```julia
using <Package1>, <Package2>
function scriptwrapper()
    X = [ones(15,1) rand(15,3)]
    y = randn(15,1)
    β = X\y # compute OLS
    return β
end
βhat = scriptwrapper()
```

- Then execute this script at the REPL by typing `include("myscript.jl")`


---

# Why do I need to wrap everything in a function?

- Wrapping code in a function allows the JIT compiler to optimize the code

- This is where the speed gains come from

- An added benefit is that it [promotes good programming practices](https://twitter.com/tyleransom/status/1227633474733060097?s=20)

    - Putting everything in a function encourages you to abstract
    
    - Abstraction usually leads to performance gains (see p. 22 [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf))

# The most common error message you'll receive

- Julia is obsessive about types

- `1.0` is different from `1` (the former is a `Float64` while the latter is an `Int64`)

- This matters: e.g. some functions are optimized to only accept `Int64` types

If you type this: `ones(π,1)`

You'll get this:

```julia
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching ones(::Irrational{:π}, ::Int64)
Closest candidates are:
  ones(::Union{Integer, AbstractUnitRange}...) at array.jl:448
  ones(::Type{T}, ::Union{Integer, AbstractUnitRange}...) where T at array.jl:449
Stacktrace:
 [1] top-level scope at none:0
```


---

# `MethodError`

- The error message on the previous slide is saying that you are violating the rules of the function you're calling

- The solution is to read the error message and note that this function requires `Integer` types as inputs

- You will also encounter error messages in the following common situations:

    - You are supplying the wrong number of inputs to a function
    
    - You are trying to call a function or object that Julia can't find
    
    - (either you haven't loaded a required package, or you haven't called that fn. yet)
    
- To resolve errors, copy the error message into a search engine and see what shows

# Cool Julia features

- My favorite feature is the ability to use Greek symbols in programming

    - To write these, just simply type the LaTeX code for the symbol and then press Tab

    - e.g. `\pi`+Tab = `π`

- Another cool feature is the `Distributions.jl` package

    - This package allows a user to specify any desired probability distribution

    - The user can take draws from it, compute quantiles or probabilities, etc.
    
- You can also double index an object

    - e.g. `X = rand(15,2)` followed by `X[2,:][2]` (though this example is silly)

---

# Comprehensions

- Another excellent feature is known as comprehensions

- Allows the user in 1 line of code to create an object that could be a complex formula

- e.g. computing a present value $\sum_{t=1}^T \beta^t Y_t$

- `PV = sum([β^t*Y[t] for t=1:T])`

- Comprehensions allow for much lighter syntax than in other languages

---

# Data Input and Output

- .hi[Read a CSV file:] `using CSV; data = CSV.read("filename.csv")`

- .hi[Write a CSV file:] `using CSV; CSV.write("filename.csv", data)`

- .hi[Save a Julia Object:] `using JLD; save("filename.jld", "object_key", object, ...)` 

    - [this is like `.dta` (Stata) or `.rda` (R)]

- .hi[Load a Julia Object:] `using JLD; d = load("filename.jld") # Returns a dict`

    - A `dict` (Dictionary) is a named list of objects [kind of like a `list()` in R]


---

# Running a regression

- The `CSV` package is usually used in concert with the `DataFrames` package

- To run Generalized Linear Model (GLM) regressions, use the `GLM` package

```julia
using CSV, DataFrames, GLM, HTTP, CategoricalArrays

# load Stata auto dataset (i.e. `sysuse auto` in Stata)
url = "https://tyleransom.github.io/teaching/MetricsLabs/auto.csv"
auto = CSV.read(HTTP.get(url).body,DataFrame)

# set `rep78` variable to be categorical
auto.rep78 = categorical(auto.rep78)

# run basic regression (`reg price mpg foreign headroom i.rep78` in Stata)
lm(@formula(price ~ mpg + foreign + headroom + rep78), auto)
```

- Tip: a function with a `!` after its name means it overwrites its input

- This is an overarching Julia convention

---

# Piping in Julia

- In R, `%>%` can be used to create piping chains

- This makes code more readable

- e.g. `x %>% mean() %>% log()` instead of `log(mean(x))`

- In Julia, you can pipe with `|>`, e.g. `x |> sum |> log`

- Note: `|>` is `|` and then `>` (it doesn't show up separately in this font)


---

# Where to go from here

- [Problem Set 1](https://github.com/OU-PhD-Econometrics/fall-2020/blob/master/ProblemSets/PS1-julia-intro/PS1.pdf) will provide ample opportunity to practice Julia

- There are other tips and tricks that you will pick up over time

- Either from the [cheatsheet](https://juliadocs.github.io/Julia-Cheat-Sheet/) or on the [Discourse site](https://discourse.julialang.org/)

- The Discourse community is really nice, even if (like me) you ask a stupid question

- Happy coding!
