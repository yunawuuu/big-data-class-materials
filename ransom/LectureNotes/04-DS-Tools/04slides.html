# Plan for the day

Cover a broad view of tools that are required in the data science pipeline


- Measurement

- Statistical programming languages

- Visualization tools (usually included with the above)

- Big Data management software

- Data collection tools


---
# Measurement

- A large part of data science (and quantitative research in general) is measurement 

- Measurement is how "insights" or "policies" are constructed 

    - one cannot construct a policy without first measuring what the policy is meant to accomplish
    
- Our class will not focus much on the "meta" question of how a particular qualitative phenomenon is measured with data, but the importance of measurement (and a solid understanding of what the data set is and is not capturing) should always be in the back of a data scientist's mind.

---
# Measurement example: basketball coaching

- How would a basketball coach quantify her "best lineup"? 

- It could be measured by comparing points scored vs. points allowed while each possible lineup is on the court

- This simple measurement is one way to quantify "best lineup" 

- Of course, the coach will likely also be interested in *why* the "best lineup" is performing as well as it is 

- In this case, she would need additional measurements to paint a clearer picture of what is happening among those particular teammates 

- Perhaps that lineup plays better defense, or passes the ball more frequently, or gets more rebounds, or ...


---
# Statistical programming languages
- 3 main mathematical and statistical programming languages we will use and discuss:
    - R
    - Python
    - Julia 
    
- There are many other languages that can be used for statistical analysis: 
    - Stata
    - SAS
    - SPSS
    - Matlab
    - and even JavaScript 
    
---
# Compiled vs. scripted

- Many of the languages listed in the prior sentence were built on C, C++, or Fortran

- The latter three are known as .hi[compiled] languages, while all other are known as .hi[scripted] languages 

- Compiled languages require the user to write code that the CPU can understand

- Scripted languages allow the user to write code that is more human-readable, at the expense of performance. 

---
# R vs. Python vs. Julia

Below is a table summarizing the main differences between R, Python, and Julia:

|                                    | R         | Python   | Julia    |
|------------------------------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Date established                   | 1995      | 1991     | 2012     |
| Approximate user base              | large     | largest  | smallest |
| Used for data science              | Yes | Yes  | Yes |
| Used for general-purpose computing | No | Yes  | Yes |
| Open source                        | Yes | Yes  | Yes |
| Web scraping package?              | `rvest`   | `BeautifulSoup` | `Gumbo.jl`, `Cascadia.jl` |
| Visualization library?             | `ggplot2` | `matplotlib` | `Plots.jl`|
| Machine learning library?          | mlr | scikit-learn | `MLJ.jl`|
| Biggest advantage                  | `tidyverse` | ubiquity | speed    |
| Biggest disadvantage               | speed     | speed    | age      |

# Which programming language should you learn?

- It depends on what you already know and what you want to do after graduation

- If you are already well acquainted with R's `tidyverse`, I would recommend using this course to learn Python or Julia

- If you don't have a good handle on R, I would recommend using this course to learn the R `tidyverse`, as it is a very popular set of DS tools

- Most of the examples in class will be in R, but we will also use Julia a bit

---
# Web Scraping

- With the proliferation of the internet, data is being collected all the time and stored in publicly accessible places (we call these webpages) 

- Thus, one of the tools in a data scientist's toolbox should be the ability to leverage this information to better inform the objective at hand (prediction, "insights", "policy", etc.) 

---
# How does web scraping work?

Typically *web scraping* involves one of two tasks:

1. Using an application program interface (API) to download data

2. Downloading HTML files and parsing their text to extract data

---
# APIs

- APIs are employed by many of the most notable web companies (twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, yelp, etc.) 

- These companies employ APIs so that they can guard their data---either for privacy concerns, or for monetary reasons 

- So, for example, although Donald Trump's tweets ~~are~~ were public record, twitter limits the number of tweets that you can extract from a timeline (3,200 currently)
    - Why do they impose this limit? I'm not sure. 

- LinkedIn limits the information that one can scrape from its website by forcing users to go to through its API (which has precious little information relative to what is in a full LinkedIn profile)

---
# Parsing

- With all of this talk about gated APIs, you might be thinking, "Why can't I just download the HTML code from the website and parse the data myself?" 

- This can be a useful option in many cases, and it is the only option for websites that don't have an API 

- One drawback to this approach is that some websites (like LinkedIn or yelp) monitor the IP addresses of all website viewers

- If you ping their website too frequently within a given period of time, they may block your access to their website

- There are also ethical considerations with collecting and using web data, which we'll cover later in the course

---
# Web scraping in the three data science languages

- Web scraping can be done in almost any programming language out there 

- However, there are convenient resources in R, Python, and Julia, which have packages built to parse HTML blocks and automatically load the data into a tabular environment for immediate analysis 

- We'll talk more about this process in a few weeks

---
# Handling large data sets

- In some cases, you might encounter data sets that are too big to fit on a single hard drive (or are too big to fit in R/Julia/Python's memory) 

- For example, consider data held by Amazon on screen clicks, cart inventory, and purchases of all of its 310 million active users

- Most desktop computers these days don't come with more than 64GB of RAM, and most laptops don't come with more than 32GB

- If you try to load into R a data set that is larger than your machine's RAM capacity, your machine will freeze and you'll have to unplug it if you want to use it again 

    - [This has happened to me a few times in the past with Matlab, so I speak from experience]

---
# Handling large data sets

- What do you do when you can't open all of your data? 

- Depending on how the data is stored, you may be able to split the files up into manageable chunks (e.g. split the huge file into 100 pieces, where each piece can fit into R on one machine)

- But that's not a viable long-term solution if your data set gets updated, or if you want to compute summary statistics on the full set of data, or if you want to do other operations on it, like create a new variable

- Fortunately, there are other programs one can use to analyze data that is too large to fit on one machine

---
# RDDs

- The solution to this problem is Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) 

- To use RDDs you need a cluster of computers and software such as Hadoop or Spark 

- Spark chops your huge data set into manageable chunks and executes actions on those chunks in parallel 

- One can do many common data operations like subsetting the data, creating summary statistics, etc. 

- The crucial aspect of RDDs is that they are built to withstand any disruption in the computing cluster 

- So if one of the machines on the cluster happens to fail, the data it was holding can be seamlessly transferred to another machine

---
# SQL (Structured Query Language)

- While not necessarily required for handling mega data sets, SQL is the most common database language to transform data into a more usable form for statistical software to use 

- With SQL, one can easily subset, merge, and perform other common data transformations

- You will get experience using both SQL and Spark a bit later in the class
 
---
# Visualization

- Visualization is an important tool for data scientists 

- Visualizing data allows humans to see in multiple dimensions what the data looks like, spot outliers, and otherwise perform "sanity checks" on the data 

- I'll review here the primary visualization tools in the three DS programming languages

---
# `ggplot2` (R)

- `ggplot2` is the visualization package included in the R `tidyverse` 

- This package has a large user following and the graphic style is immediately recognizable

- I personally don't care for the design aesthetic, but it can be hard to argue with ubiquity

- If you're interested in learning this, I recommend checking out the [data visualization](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and [graphics for communication](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html) chapters in the [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) online textbook

---
# `matplotlib` (Python)

- `matplotlib` is the original graphics package for Python 

- It was designed to mimic Matlab's visualization syntax 

- Beyond `matplotlib`, there is a `ggplot` package which ports to `ggplot2`, as well as a variety of others

---
# `Plots.jl` (Julia)

- `Plots.jl` is a package that came about recently 

- Its innovation is that, once the user provides it with code, it can output graphics using any other package as a backend 

- For example, a user can write some code to create a data visualization which creates a graphic using `ggplot2` 

- Then, by only tweaking one option in that code, the user could output the same graphic in `matplotlib` 

- This package is a nice way to only have to code once but be able to create graphics in many different styles

---
# Tableau

- Tableau is a software company that produces interactive data visualization products

- Tableau primarily bills itself as an interactive product, but there are workarounds to interact with JavaScript and R (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18754853/scripts-or-plug-ins-for-tableau))

- We won't be covering Tableau in this course, but it is a commonly used visualization tool in the real world, so you should at least know what it is

---
# Modeling

- Now that you've collected your data, cleaned it up, and visualized it, you're ready to start doing some statistical modeling 

- The main objectives of statistical modeling are as follows:

    1. Use the data to test theories
    
    2. Use the data to predict behavior
    
    3. Use the data to explain behavior

---
# Modeling

1. Use the data to test theories 

    - For example, Amazon may wonder "Are women more likely than men to subscribe to Prime?" Without data this is simply a "hunch" or a belief
    
2. Use the data to predict behavior 

    - For example, many companies need to optimize their inventory management so that the right amount of inventory is in the right stores at the right time
    
3. Use the data to explain behavior 

    - This is a bit more difficult, because it requires causality, not just prediction
