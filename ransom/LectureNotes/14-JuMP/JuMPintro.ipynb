    "*Uses JuMP version 0.21*\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is JuMP?\n",
    "JuMP stands for **Ju**lia for **M**athematical Programming. It is a \"domain-specific modeling language for mathematical optimization embedded in Julia.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What does \"domain-specific\" mean? It means that some algorithms are useful in some knowledge domains (e.g. supply chain management) that may not be useful in other knowledge domains (e.g. estimating statistical model parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is great about JuMP is that it allows the user to change algorithms with little or no change to the modeling code. This means that someone without domain-specific knowledge can easily utilize JuMP to accomplish a task that would otherwise be impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What goes into JuMP?\n",
    "To use JuMP, a user must specify the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An objective function (you gotta solve something!)\n",
    "- Variables\n",
    "- Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "JuMP does the rest! (I'll show you examples shortly of how you can do this.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kinds of problems can JuMP handle?\n",
    "JuMP provides the ability to solve the following types of objective functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear\n",
    "- Convex Quadratic\n",
    "- Nonlinear (convex and nonconvex)\n",
    "\n",
    "It also provides the ability to use constraints of the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear\n",
    "- Convex Quadratic\n",
    "- Second-order Conic\n",
    "- Semidefinite\n",
    "- Nonlinear (convex and nonconvex)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it provides support for any of the following types of variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuous\n",
    "- Integer-valued\n",
    "- Semicontinuous\n",
    "- Semi-integer\n",
    "\n",
    "### What examples will we go through today?\n",
    "Today I'll go through four examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve a very simple constrained system of equations (adapted from JuMP's Github repository [here](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl/blob/master/examples/basic.jl))\n",
    "2. Solve a Sudoku puzzle (adapted from JuMP's Github repository [here](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl/blob/master/examples/sudoku.jl))\n",
    "3. Solve a professional sports team's salary budget problem\n",
    "4. Estimate the parameters of a linear regression model\n",

    "## 1. A simple constrained system of equations\n",
    "Suppose you want to solve the following (constrained) system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\max\\,\\, 5x + 3y\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x + 5y & \\leq 3 \\\\\n",
    "x & \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "y & \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "x & \\leq 2 \\\\\n",
    "y & \\leq 30 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In economics, this problem may represent a utility maximization problem, where utility is linear in $x$ and $y$, the individul has an income of 3, and the price of good $x$ is 1, with the price of good $y$ equal to 5. (And there are supply constraints on $x$ and $y$ governed by the market in general.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to, we could solve this using a Lagrangian (although in this case with linear utility, we know we will have a corner solution, so no need to bother with calculus). \n",
    "\n",
    "But we want the computer to do this, so let's see how it's done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying the model components\n",
    "As explained above, JuMP needs an objective function, variables, and constraints. Additionally, we need to tell JuMP which optimization algorithm to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimizer\n",
    "The first step is to declare a model and attach an optimizer. We are going to use the GLPK optimizer:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "model = Model(GLPK.Optimizer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "Next, we need to tell it what the variables are, and any constraints on those variables:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "@variable(model, 0 <= x <= 2)\n",
    "@variable(model, 0 <= y <= 30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective function\n",
    "Next, we tell it the objective function (and whether we want to maximize or minimize):\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "@objective(model, Max, 5x + 3y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "Finally, we give it the constraints. Note that the single constraints on each variable were incorporated when we declared the variables themselves, but we have one additional constraint that is a function of both variables. We could also impose a constraint that the optimal values of $x$ and $y$ be integers (if these represented indivisible objects, for example).\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "@constraint(model, 1x + 5y <= 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizing the model\n",
    "Once we have all of the components declared, we can optimize the model:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "JuMP.optimize!(model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then look at the output of the optimization as follows:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "obj_value = JuMP.objective_value(model)\n",
    "x_value   = JuMP.value(x)\n",
    "y_value   = JuMP.value(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We'll put all of the code together below so it can be run on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Julia protocol, we will also wrap everything in a function and then call that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All of the code together"

    "### Sudoku objective\n",
    "In this case, the objective function is to fill in the puzzle board given a starting grid that has some numbers filled in. We won't have a formal objective function for this; we will just give JuMP a starting grid and tell it to satisfy all of the constraints, where one of the constraints is that the board gets filled. (A blank board has an infinite number of solutions, but a partially completed board should have just one unique solution.)\n",

    "We will communicate the state of the puzzle board with an array of variables. The variables will be put in a 3-dimensional array, where the first two dimensions tell the \"latitude\" and \"longitude\" of the cell on the puzzle board, and the third dimension keeps track of which of the numbers 1-9 will fill that cell.\n",
