# What is Data Science?

- .hi[Data science (DS):] The scientific discipline that deals with transforming data into useful information ("insights") using a variety of stats/ML techniques

    - Amazon: Collects data on search history, cart history, purchases

    - Analyzes the data to estimate users' willingness to pay for various products (including Prime); recommend new products

- The rise of data science has come because of the so-called Big Data revolution

    - The rise of the internet in the late-1990s and 2000s `\(\Rightarrow \,\uparrow\)`opportunities for companies and governments to collect data on consumers &amp; citizens

    - Proliferation of mobile devices &amp; social media from late 2000s until now has generated even more data

# Pillars of data science

- Programming (for automation of data collection, manipulation, cleaning, visualization, and modeling)

- Visualization &amp; exploration

- Machine learning (to select models, compress data)

- Causal inference (to be able to make a policy prescription)

...Assuming one has the appropriate foundation of basic calculus and statistics

# What is Big Data?

It depends on who you ask. It could mean:

1. "Wild" data (unstructured; collected without a particular intention; e.g. twitter, contrast with Census surveys)

2. "Wide" data (a.k.a. "Big-K" data because `\(K&gt;N\)`)

3. "Long" data (a.k.a. "Big-N" data because `\(N\)` very, very large [and may not all fit onto a single hard drive!])

4. Any data set that cannot be analyzed with classical methods like OLS (e.g. all combinations of the above three types)

"Big Data" not so much about size of data, but about whether or not "small data" (read: classical) methods can be used






---
# What is machine learning? What is AI?

- .hi[Machine learning (ML):] Allowing computers to learn for themselves without explicitly being programmed

    - USPS: Computer to read handwriting on envelopes

    - Google: AlphaGo, computer that defeated world champion Go player

    - Apple/Amazon/Microsoft: Siri, Alexa, Cortana voice assistants 

- .hi[Artificial intelligence (AI):] Constructing machines (robots, computers) to think and act like human beings

- ML is a subset of AI



---
# Big data &amp; machine learning

- You'll often hear the phrase "big data and machine learning"

- This is because many machine learning algorithms are helpful for big data problems:

    - Selecting which `\(k&lt;K\)` covariates should enter your model

    - Streamlined techniques for processing "wild" data

    - New modeling approaches that can leverage the greater amount of information that Big Data has



---
# Correlation vs. causation

- Machine learning is not the end-all, be-all of data science

- A good data scientist knows that correlation is not causation!

- Ultimately companies want "insights" that they can use to `\(\uparrow\)`profits

- Tech co.'s run randomized experiments to estimate causal effects

- Can also estimate fancier statistical models to account for selection

- Economists' comparative advantage is in combining machine learning with economic theory to produce optimal policies




---
# Example

&gt; One very classic example comes from looking at the data of a shopping cart. Why do sales of beer and diapers go hand in hand? The correlation is women tell their husbands to go pick up diapers, and on the way, they pick up beer, too. That is data science: finding trends from your data and using that insight to increase your sales or market better

# ChatGPT

- I strongly encourage you to use ChatGPT in all aspects of this class

- ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI

- Create an account at http://chat.openai.com/

- ChatGPT is excellent at producing basic code and helping resolve bugs

- It takes most of the headache away from coding, leaving only the fun parts

# ChatGPT example from PS3 later in the semester

**Human: (question 5 from PS3)**

Write a SQL script that does the following:

(a) Read in the Florida insurance data CSV file

(b) Print out the first 10 rows of the data set

(c) List which counties are in the sample (i.e. list unique values of the county variable)

(d) Compute the average property appreciation from 2011 to 2012 (i.e. compute the
mean of tiv_2012 - tiv_2011)

(e) Create a frequency table of the construction variable to see what fraction of
buildings are made out of wood or some other material


---
# ChatGPT example (continued)

**Assistant:**

Assuming the Florida insurance data is stored in a table called "insurance" and the columns are named "county", "tiv_2011", "tiv_2012", and "construction", the SQL script would be as follows:

.scroll-box-8[
```sql
-- (a) Read in the Florida insurance data CSV file
CREATE TABLE insurance (county VARCHAR(255), tiv_2011 INT, tiv_2012 INT, construction VARCHAR(255));
LOAD DATA INFILE 'florida_insurance.csv' INTO TABLE insurance
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;

-- (b) Print out the first 10 rows of the data set
SELECT * FROM insurance LIMIT 10;

-- (c) List which counties are in the sample (i.e. list unique values of the county variable)
SELECT DISTINCT county FROM insurance;

-- (d) Compute the average property appreciation from 2011 to 2012 (i.e. compute the mean of tiv_2012 - tiv_2011)
SELECT AVG(tiv_2012 - tiv_2011) FROM insurance;

-- (e) Create a frequency table of the construction variable to see what fraction of buildings are made out of wood or some other material
SELECT construction, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM insurance GROUP BY construction;

```
]

Note: This is basic SQL script and it may vary based on the database you are using. You may need to make some modification accordingly.

# Grading

- Because ChatGPT has such a vast potential to help you, I will grade problem sets much more strictly than I have in the past

- If your code doesn't run, you won't get credit for it

- You should always make sure your code will run start-to-finish and with ChatGPT as a resource, there is no excuse to not turn in perfect code


---
# Final project

- A large portion of your grade will come from a final project

- You should find a research question you're interested in and some data you can use to answer it

- If you are short on ideas, check out https://www.kaggle.com/datasets which routinely hosts analytics competitions

- Kaggle publishes data for each competition

- Main criterion for the project is to apply skills developed in this class

- If you have more questions, please come see me
